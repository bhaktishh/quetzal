-- TODO: change many, some, satisfy to takeWhileP and takeWhile1P for efficiency
-- is there a way i can add a list of variables and types to carry around? or should that be a second pass
-- how many passes is too many passes
-- also shouldn't idris handle all that
-- maybe idris shouldn't maybe this should have a dependent typechecker of its own
-- maybe the goal is efficiency and i can do the custom data representation stuff

-- variables must begin with a lowercase letter
-- type metavariables must be all uppercase
-- type names and type constructor names must begin with an uppercase letter
-- non parameterized types must include "<>"
